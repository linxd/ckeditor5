# Document editor

The 编辑器 in this example is a feature–rich 创建 focused on rich text editing experience similar to the native word processors. It works best for creating documents which are usually later printed or exported to PDF files.

See the {@link framework/guides/document-editor tutorial} to learn how to create this kind of an editor (and similar) with a custom UI layout on top of {@link module:editor-decoupled/decouplededitor~DecoupledEditor}.
